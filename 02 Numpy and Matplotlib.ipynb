Foundational libraries such as Matplotlib and Pandas, as well as machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn, which we will discuss in future weeks, often use NumPy arrays as input.

For example, fMRI data can typically be represented as 4D arrays (3 dimensions represent x,y,z axis of the brain volume + 1 dimension of time points).\n",

This makes the numpy array memory more efficient compared to the list, and Python doesn't need to check the data type of the elements when performing the operation. Also, NumPy supports broadcasting and vectorized operations (we will mention them later), which can apply operations to the entire array without looping over individual elements.

A function is called with `function(object, arguments)`. If you see an object followed by a word with brackets, you would know it is a method. Method is called by `object.method(arguments)`(arguments are optional). The main difference is that method is bound to an object, but function is not. \n",

Similar to method, attribute is also associated with object and different types of objects in Python have their own attributes. The main difference between attribute and function/method is: attribute represents some **characteristic or property** of the object, it doesn't do anything on the object but only **tells something** about the object. In contrast, function/method **does something** or **performs a task** on the object. For example, *object.sum()* method calculates the sum of the object, whereas *object.shape* attribute tells me the shape of the object, which is a property belonging to the object itself. \n",
