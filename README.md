**Instructors**: [Mengfan Zhang (张梦凡)](https://ufind.univie.ac.at/en/person.html?id=113298), [Dominik Pegler](https://ufind.univie.ac.at/en/person.html?id=1001597) and [József Arato](https://ufind.univie.ac.at/en/person.html?id=108388)

**Lectures.**
Wednesdays 13:15-14:45 in Room B, 6th floor, NIG.

**Labs.** 
Wednesdays 15:00-16:30 in Room B, 6th floor, NIG.

**Course number**:  
200233 SE Theory and Empirical Research 1 (Master Psychology, 840 [2] - Version 2017)

**Contact information and moodle**:  
The [moodle course](https://moodle.univie.ac.at/course/view.php?id=358850) is the main point of contact. We use it for questions and class discussions. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, please post your questions on moodle. It will get you a faster response and the answer will benefit others with the same question.

If you have a question that isn't suitable for moodle and there is a need to email the teaching staff directly, please use the following email address: **mengfan.zhang@univie.ac.at**

**Course summary and learning goals**: This course provides an introduction to the leading computational frameworks for understanding human behavior and cognition. Psychologists are increasingly confronted with large amounts of human behavioral data, and computational methods can help make sense of this data. The course focuses on practical and programming aspects, while also discussing the theoretical implications for psychology and cognitive science. To this end, the course will consist of conceptual lectures for the first 90 minutes, followed by programming labs for another 90 minutes every Wednesday. 

The course will be divided into three parts. The first part will introduce the Python programming language and the most important libraries for data analysis, including Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. The second part will focus on general data science methods, such as statistical inference with resampling methods, regression models, and machine learning. In the final section of the course, we will apply the programming skills we have acquired to model concepts that are particularly relevant to cognitive science, such as neural networks and reinforcement learning.

Weekly homework assignments will involve testing and implementing the techniques taught in the current and possibly previous weeks. The final project will require students to work in groups on a specific topic to analyze data, write a proposal, and present the project in class. By the end of the course, students will have a more comprehensive understanding of how computational methods advance psychology, how psychology can inform research in machine learning and AI, and how cognitive models are adapted and evaluated to understand behavioral data.


## Pre-requisites
- Mathematics: Although concepts from linear algebra, calculus and probability theory are used, it is not necessary to have a very comprehensive understanding of them. We will review some of the basic concepts in the lab.

- Programming: Previous knowledge of Python is not mandatory, but strongly recommended as the course topics become increasingly complex. Python 3 and [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org) are used for the in-class and homework assignments.
 
## Grading
The final grade is based on the homeworks (50%), the in-class evaluations (15%) and the final project (35%).   

## Final Project
The final project proposal is due May 30 (0.5 pages written). Please submit via moodle **with the file name lastname1-lastname2-lastname3-tewa1-proposal.pdf**. Make sure to include the names of all of your group members at the top of the document too.

The final project is due June 20. Please submit via moodle **with the file name lastname1-lastname2-lastname3-tewa1-final.pdf**. Make sure to include the names of all of your group members at the top of the document too.

The final project will be done in groups of 3-4 students. A short paper will be turned in describing the project (approximately 6 pages). The project will represent either a substantial extension of one of the homeworks (e.g., exploring some new aspect of one of the assignments), implementing and extending an existing cognitive modeling paper, or a cognitive modeling project related to your research.  We provide a list of project ideas [here](final_project_ideas.md), but of course, you do not have to choose from this list.

**The final project must relate to psychology and cannot be a purely machine learning / data science project.** Thus, your project must connect, in some way, to the human mind and behavior. This could be collecting (informally) behavioral data to compare your computational model to. Or you could compare your model against results in the literature or particular dataset of human behavior or ratings. Or you could compare your algorithm with human intelligence in a more abstract sense. There are many ways to make the connection, but your final project must connect to psychology.

Your write-ups should be organized and written as a scientific paper. We encourage you to use this an APA7 template. It must include the following sections: Introduction (with review of related work), Methods/Models, Results, and Discussion/Conclusion. Here is a good example:   
Singh, P., Peterson, J. C., Battleday, R. M., & Griffiths, T. L. (2020). End-to-end deep prototype and exemplar models for predicting human behavior. Proceedings of the 42nd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society. [link here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08723)

Code submission is also required for the final project.

## Readings
For each major topic, there are assigned readings that go with the lectures. The papers were selected to be fundamental readings on this topic any computational cognitive scientist would be expected to know.  You should aim to read these over the semester, especially during the periods when we are covering the same topic. The papers should be downloadable on https://usearch.univie.ac.at/.

## Course policies and FAQ

**Collaboration and honor code**:  
We take the collaboration policy and [academic integrity](https://cas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/cas/academic-integrity.html) very seriously. Violations of the policy will result in zero points and a possible disciplinary referral. You may discuss the homework assignments with your classmates, but **you must run the simulations and complete the write-ups **for the **homework** on your** own.** Under no circumstance should students look at each other’s code or write-ups, or code/write-ups from previous years of this course. Do not share your write-up or code with any of your classmates under any circumstances.

**Late work**:  
We will take 10% off each day a homework or final project is late. Assignments should be turned in all at once and not in pieces. If an assignment is incomplete and later completed, the late penalty is applied to the entire assignment.

**Extensions**:  
If you are requesting an extension, email the teaching team (mengfan.zhang@univie.ac.at) and explain the reason. You must submit a request for an extension at least 24 hours before the due date of the assignment.

**Did you forget to turn in part of the homework, or did it print improperly on the PDF?**:  
**We will not regrade homework because your answer did not display correctly in the version you submitted.** Before turning in your assignment, you must double-check that all of your answers appear clearly in the PDF printout.
