**Contact information and moodle**:  
The moodle course is the main point of contact. We use it for questions and class discussions. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, please post your questions on moodle. It will get you a faster response and the answer will benefit others with the same question.

If you have a question that isn't suitable for moodle and there is a need to email the teaching staff directly, please use one of the following email addresses: **mengfan.zhang@univie.ac.at**, **dominik.pegler@univie.ac.at** and **jozsef.arato@univie.ac.at**
