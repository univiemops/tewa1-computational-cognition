**Course number**:  
200233 SE Theory and Empirical Research 1 (Master Psychology, 840 [2] - Version 2017)

**Contact information and moodle**:  
The [moodle course](https://moodle.univie.ac.at/course/view.php?id=358850) is the main point of contact. We use it for questions and class discussions. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, please post your questions on moodle. It will get you a faster response and the answer will benefit others with the same question.

If you have a question that isn't suitable for moodle and there is a need to email the teaching staff directly, please use the following email address: **mengfan.zhang@univie.ac.at**

**Summary**: This course is an introduction to working with the leading computational frameworks for understanding human cognition. Psychologists are confronted with increasing amounts of human behavioral data. We want to use computational cognitive modeling and this behavioral data to understand the mind and the brain by building computational models of the cognitive processes that produce this data. While the focus of the course is on the practical and programming aspects, we will also discuss the theoretical aspects of these topics for cognitive science. Lectures will focus on the theory; in the labs we will program using practical examples.

The course will be divided into three parts: The first part is a general introduction to the Python programming language and the most important libraries for data analysis: Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pandas. The second part of the course focuses on general data science methods (statistical inference with resampling methods, regression models, machine learning). In the last part of the course, we will apply the learned programming to models of particular relevance to cognitive science (Bayesian modeling, deep learning, and reinforcement learning).

Homework assignments will include testing and implementing the methods learned in class. Students will leave the course with a broader understanding of how computational methods advance psychology, how psychology can inform research in machine learning and AI, and how cognitive models are adapted and evaluated to understand behavioral data.

## Pre-requisites
- Mathematics: Although concepts from linear algebra, calculus and probability theory are used, it is not necessary to have a very comprehensive understanding of them. We will review some of the basic concepts in the lab.

- Programming: Previous knowledge of Python is not mandatory, but strongly recommended as the course topics become increasingly complex. Python 3 and [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org) are used for the in-class and homework assignments.
 
## Grading
The final grade is based on the homeworks (50%), the in-class evaluations (15%) and the final project (35%).   

## Final Project
The final project proposal is due May 30 (0.5 pages written). Please submit via moodle **with the file name lastname1-lastname2-lastname3-tewa1-proposal.pdf**. Make sure to include the names of all of your group members at the top of the document too.

The final project is due June 20. Please submit via moodle **with the file name lastname1-lastname2-lastname3-tewa1-final.pdf**. Make sure to include the names of all of your group members at the top of the document too.

The final project will be done in groups of 3-4 students. A short paper will be turned in describing the project (approximately 6 pages). The project will represent either a substantial extension of one of the homeworks (e.g., exploring some new aspect of one of the assignments), implementing and extending an existing cognitive modeling paper, or a cognitive modeling project related to your research.  We provide a list of project ideas [here](final_project_ideas.md), but of course, you do not have to choose from this list.

**The final project must relate to psychology and cannot be a purely machine learning / data science project.** Thus, your project must connect, in some way, to the human mind and behavior. This could be collecting (informally) behavioral data to compare your computational model to. Or you could compare your model against results in the literature or particular dataset of human behavior or ratings. Or you could compare your algorithm with human intelligence in a more abstract sense. There are many ways to make the connection, but your final project must connect to psychology.

Your write-ups should be organized and written as a scientific paper. We encourage you to use this an APA7 template. It must include the following sections: Introduction (with review of related work), Methods/Models, Results, and Discussion/Conclusion. Here is a good example:   
Singh, P., Peterson, J. C., Battleday, R. M., & Griffiths, T. L. (2020). End-to-end deep prototype and exemplar models for predicting human behavior. Proceedings of the 42nd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society. [link here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08723)

Code submission is also required for the final project.

## Readings
For each major topic, there are assigned readings that go with the lectures. The papers were selected to be fundamental readings on this topic any computational cognitive scientist would be expected to know.  You should aim to read these over the semester, especially during the periods when we are covering the same topic. The papers should be downloadable on https://usearch.univie.ac.at/.

## Course policies and FAQ

**Collaboration and honor code**:  
We take the collaboration policy and [academic integrity](https://cas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/cas/academic-integrity.html) very seriously. Violations of the policy will result in zero points and a possible disciplinary referral. You may discuss the homework assignments with your classmates, but **you must run the simulations and complete the write-ups **for the **homework** on your** own.** Under no circumstance should students look at each other’s code or write-ups, or code/write-ups from previous years of this course. Do not share your write-up or code with any of your classmates under any circumstances.

**Late work**:  
We will take 10% off each day a homework or final project is late. Assignments should be turned in all at once and not in pieces. If an assignment is incomplete and later completed, the late penalty is applied to the entire assignment.

**Extensions**:  
If you are requesting an extension, email the teaching team (mengfan.zhang@univie.ac.at) and explain the reason. You must submit a request for an extension at least 24 hours before the due date of the assignment.

**Did you forget to turn in part of the homework, or did it print improperly on the PDF?**:  
**We will not regrade homework because your answer did not display correctly in the version you submitted.** Before turning in your assignment, you must double-check that all of your answers appear clearly in the PDF printout.
