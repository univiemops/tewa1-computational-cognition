    "We will show you how to perform linear regression with one or more predictors in Python. We will start by creating fake data using a regression model with known parameters, and then fit that data to another linear regression model and see how well we can recover the model parameters of the first model. This approach is very common and provides a benchmark for evaluating the performance of different models. After visualizing the regression and evaluating model performance, we will use bootstrapping to model confidence intervals around our parameter values to show how confident or certain we are about them. Finally, we will show you how to use regression models to test hypotheses.\n",

Simulate 200 car prices from the last 70 years, with the assumption that while as cars get older they are cheaper, however very old cars, have a vintage value, that is eventually if the are old enough they could worth more than a new car. Use a standard devation of EUR 10,000. Hint: Use a linear model for the simualtion with a two predictors, and linear and a quadratic term. Test different values for the two slopes, simulate data, until you manage to simulate realistic car prices, that satisfy the above criteria.."
