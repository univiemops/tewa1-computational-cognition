    "\n",
    "Each week a few students (usually 3) are selected to explain the exercises they have submitted. This selection process is defined as **random sampling without replacement within a week** (so the same student cannot be selected more than once in a week) and **with replacement across weeks**. This means that if a student has been selected, he or she can be selected again next week, but the selection reduces the probability of being selected by a factor (e.g., 3) relative to the probabilities of the other students."
