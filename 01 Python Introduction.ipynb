    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is an application that allows you to write/edit/run/share Python code in a web browser. We use it for our course tutorials because it is an excellent combination of *text cell*,  which allows to write text to explain things, and *code cell*,  which allows to execute code and see the results immediately. Also, it allows to embed rich inputs and outputs such as plots, images, equations, making it an excellent teaching tool for data visualization and scientific computing. \\\n",
    "Here, we just briefly explain the most important things about how to use jupyter notebooks. If you are interested in the detailed usages, you can check out the user documentation (https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Runing and stopping cells** \\\n",
    "To run a cell, select it (it should have a green frame (edit mode) or a blue frame (command mode) around it), and then click on the \"Run\" icon in the toolbar above or press \"Shift + Enter\". \\\n",
    "In some cases, such as when the code cell is taking too long to execute or the loop you created is infinite, you may want to stop the cell from executing. To do this, click the black square icon in the toolbar. \\\n",
    "Even worse, you accidentally crash the notebook (this can happen sometimes when you load too much data), and the notebook stop responding and the stop icon doesn't help. You may need to completely restart the notebook. To do this, click \"Kernel\" --> \"Restart\" in the toolbar.  It's important to note that when you restart the notebook, all the things (data/variables/libraries) you imported before will not be remembered. So you have to re-import everything by running the code cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Inserting and deleting cells** \\\n",
    "By clicking on \"Insert\" --> \"Insert Cell Above\"/\"Insert Cell Below\" in the toolbar, you can add a new code cell. To delete a cell, click on \"Edit\" --> \"Delete Cells\". \\\n",
    "If you want to change the code cell into a text cell, select the cell and click \"Cell\" --> \"Cell Type\" --> \"Markdown\". The markdown cells (or the text cells) allow you to write plain text and format your text using special markdown syntax. Check out this cheatsheet to get an idea of the basic markdown syntax (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Saving and closing notebook** \\\n",
    "When running the notebook in a browser, remember that it is very similar to working on a file on your computer that you need to save things you changed from time to time. Click on the fist icon in the toolbar to save the notebook, especially before closing the notebook! \\\n",
    "If you want to close the notebook, you can simply close the web page in your browser. However, the notebook will still be \"running\" in the background in the terminal. This isn't a big problem for the course, but we recommend that you click \"File\" --> \"Close and Halt\" to shut down the notebook completely if you are running notebooks on your own computer. Otherwise, you may have notebooks keep running in your terminal without awareness about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's do some practice (optional)! Insert a text cell below, and try to write the following sentence by yourself: \\\n",

A function is defined with the `def` statement, and followed by the function name, parentheses `()` with arguments to the function, and a colon `:`.

Function and method are related but not the same, the main difference lies in **the association with an object**. Functions are standalone and are called by `function(arguments)`, while methods are functions that are associated with and operate on objects and are called by `object.method(arguments)`. Different types of objects in Python come with their own distinct set of methods.  \n",
